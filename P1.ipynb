    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "Congratulations on finding the lane lines!  As the final step in this project, we would like you to share your thoughts on your lane finding pipeline... specifically, how could you imagine making your algorithm better / more robust?  Where will your current algorithm be likely to fail?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please add your thoughts below,  and if you're up for making your pipeline more robust, be sure to scroll down and check out the optional challenge video below!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several possible enhancements for this algorithm - it is particularly not robust under challenging light conditions and where constrat between lane markers and the road is poor. It is also very likely to fail if we were to find painted markings in the road (crosswalks, stop and crossing signs, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below a few ideas to improve dealing with light conditions and contrast:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use lane markers from previous frames (implemented)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since lane markers shouldn't abruptly change direction, it is possible to use lane markers detected in previous frames when calculating the lane markers for the current frame. This provides very good hints under tough conditions, keep the markers transitioning smoothly and deal with possible undetected markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adpative threshols for color selection (implemented and discarded)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use an adaptive threshold for color selection. Since we might end up masking too much or too little information from the image, a possibility is to adjust the masking thresholds based on a minimum percentage of pixels that must be non-black during color selection. The obvious drawback is the extra computational effort required to perform multiple color selection runs per frame. (tested and removed given the extra computational effort compared to additional gain)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter outliers (implemented)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use slopes median and standard deviation to discard outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter lines with unexpected slopes (implemented)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the position of the camera in the car, we can assume (when already inside a lane) that the lane markers slopes would fall in a specified range. Although this works well for the kind of scenarios in this lesson, it would probably not work when dealing with other common situation (e.g., a conversion in an intersection where the lanes we're looking for are perpendicular to the car).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dealing with missing markers\n",
    "\n",
    "If one lane marker is missing (alg. couldn't detect it) we can still use the opposite lane marker as a guide for where we would expect the missing lane marker to be. Not very important since this is also addressed by the weighted average of markers found on previous frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving slope accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the slope, give a higher weight to points closer to the camera, since those tend to be more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use more than one color space for color selection (partially implemented)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use other color spaces in order to perform a more robust color selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other image improvements (partially implemented)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the implemented algorithm we're equalizing the image to improve contrast. Better constrast improvement algorithms could be used to more robustly detect the lane markers.\n"
